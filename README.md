 - Future goals:
   * Add additional paths that could link up to other paths within the game.
   * Add collective items to be used during game play.
   * Add HTML and CSS styling to game to make it more visually stimulating.

  - Audience: 

    * This game is designed mostly for a younger audience but can be played by all ages, its an interesting way to show younger players how text based games are created.

    ## Lucid chart 
   * Escape the witches garden is a text-based game, for this reason no work was done for creating front end styling using HTML and CSS. Instead focus was put on creating a diagram of the application and using that as a base for creating the code.
