 ## Project Audience and target goals.
- Completed goals:
   * Built a fun text-based game using Python that lets you choose different options which results in different outcomes.
   
 - Future goals:
   * Add additional paths that could link up to other paths within the game.
   * Add collective items to be used during game play.
   * Add HTML and CSS styling to game to make it more visually stimulating.

  - Audience: 

    * This game is designed mostly for a younger audience but can be played by all ages, its an interesting way to show younger players how text based games are created.

    ## Lucid chart 
   * Escape the witches garden is a text-based game, for this reason no work was done for creating front end styling using HTML and CSS. Instead focus was put on creating a diagram of the application and using that as a base for creating the code.

 ## User Experience 
  ### First time playing
  - As a first time player I want to understand the main purpose of the site and have an enjoyable experience playing a text-based game.
  - At entry the player is greeted with a welcoming message and the rules of the game are explained easily.
  - The player is then asked to enter their player name and the game begins.
  - The game runs at a comfortable speed allowing the player to read the story easily as they progress.
  - A different color of text is used for each character, this makes it easier for the player to differ from story line to characters speaking making it easier to follow.
  
  ### Returning player
   - As a returning player I want to attempt to play the game better than the first, by choosing different inputs and seeing the different out put results.
   - The returning player will be more familiar with the paths and will know which path they should not take from previous game play.
